Dataset Overview:
Source: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. It focuses on the happiness scores of people across different countries, with factors such as GDP, crime rate, life expectancy, and employment being the primary indicators.

Objective:
Goal: The objective of this project was to predict the happiness score of individuals based on factors like GDP, crime rate, life expectancy, and employment.

Data Preparation:
Target Variable: The target variable for the model was the happiness score. Key predictors included crime rate, employment, GDP, and life expectancy.

Data Cleaning: Certain columns that did not directly relate to predicting the happiness score were removed to improve model accuracy.

Model Training:
Approach: I used the default quick-build approach for training, which helped refine the dataset and ensure that the model was as precise as possible.

Model Evaluation:
Results: The model achieved an R² score of -5.718%, which highlights the complexity of predicting happiness. Despite using a well-trained model and high-quality data, the task proved to be extremely challenging. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) score was 1.493, which, while better than the R² score, still indicates that predicting happiness remains a difficult and dynamic problem.
